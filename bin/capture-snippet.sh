# Primary use is the unpacked extension (extension/), which injects window.__cap
# on every page automatically. Use this only when you can't/won't load the
# extension: it copies the engine to the clipboard so you can paste it into
# Chrome DevTools > Sources > Snippets (one-time), then drive it from the
# Console:
#   __cap.on(sel) / __cap.scan(sel) / __cap.dump() / __cap.libs() / __cap.gsap()
#
# Chrome stores DevTools Snippets in an internal LevelDB, not a file, so there
# is no way to drop the snippet straight in from a script — hence clipboard.
#
# The engine is installed by ./install.sh to:
#   ~/.local/share/yoinkit/capture-animation.js

Paste it once into Chrome:
  DevTools (F12) → Sources → Snippets → New snippet → paste → Ctrl+S
Run it (Ctrl+Enter) on any page, then in the Console:
  __cap.libs()                          list animation libraries in use
  __cap.on('.selector')                 capture one element on hover (default)
  __cap.on('.sel',{trigger:'scroll'})   capture on scroll-into-view
  __cap.scan('.section')                find what moves in a region
                                        (use for layers you cannot click)
  __cap.gsap()                          inspect logged GSAP/CustomEase evidence
  __cap.boot({selectors:['h1'],ms:4000}) watch early load/reveal motion
  __cap.bootDump()                      finalize a boot capture
  __cap.dump()                          finalize → copies the .animation.json

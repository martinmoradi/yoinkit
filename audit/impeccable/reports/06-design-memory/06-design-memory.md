# Impeccable Persisted Design-Memory → a Measured Motion Memory for YoinkIt — Deep Technical Audit

**Subsystem:** Impeccable's **persisted design-memory** — the durable,
git-tracked, `schemaVersion`-stamped `.impeccable/design.json` captured from a
project and committed into its repo. Its `extensions.motion` block (read in the
context of its `colorMeta` / `typographyMeta` / `shadows` / `breakpoints` /
`roundedMeta` siblings), the LLM **generation** path that writes it
(`/impeccable document`), the documented **v1→v2 migration** and the
`mdNewerThanJson` staleness signal, the **enforcement reader**
(`cli/engine/design-system.mjs`) that folds it into an allowed set and flags
off-system drift, the live-panel **merge** that returns it beside the parsed
prose, and the one-field **Register** taxonomy that flips its motion doctrine.

**Audience:** the YoinkIt team. YoinkIt captures what a web animation *actually
does* (per-frame computed-style sampling) and emits a **measured spec, not code** —
but it emits it as a **throwaway, gitignored, per-run** artifact
(`*.animation.json`, `yoink-runs/{host}/{date}-{slug}/`) with **no cross-run, per-
site memory**. Impeccable — a *static design* tool — has already built and shipped
the durable, versioned, accumulating, enforceable motion-carrying artifact that
YoinkIt — a *motion* tool — structurally lacks. This report goes to the floor on
that artifact and ends with a concrete, implementable **`motion.json`** proposal:
the *measured* counterpart to Impeccable's *authored* memory.

**Hold the inversion the whole way** (see [`00-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md`](../../00-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md)
and the [06 survey](../../06-UNEXPLORED-TERRITORY.md) lines 180-186): Impeccable's
design memory is **prescriptive and authored** — an LLM writes down the design a
project *should* follow, and the reader enforces code against that authored ideal.
YoinkIt's motion memory must be **measured and observed** — the `__cap` engine
writes down what a site *actually does*, frame by frame, and a linter would check a
new animation against the site's own empirical vocabulary. Same shape (a committed,
versioned, enforced token file), opposite physics (authored ideal vs measured
norm). The thing to **not** copy is the generation path — an LLM inventing tokens.
The new object exists in neither tool today, which is exactly why it is the
strongest angle.

All paths are under `../../source/` unless noted; YoinkIt paths are under the repo
root.

## 1. Orientation: a memory, three disciplines, one conditioner

Impeccable's design memory is one committed file backed by three disciplines and
conditioned by one field:

- **The artifact** ([`06a`](06a-the-persisted-artifact.md)) — `.impeccable/design.json`,
  `schemaVersion: 2`, a bag of optional token-metadata blocks (`extensions.colorMeta`
  … `extensions.motion`), self-contained `components`, and a `narrative` of human
  intent. Committed to git, alongside `config.json` and `live/config.json`.
- **Generation** ([`06b`](06b-generation-and-migration.md)) — `/impeccable document`
  has an **LLM write** the memory: `DESIGN.md` prose, then the sidecar as "extensions
  only", with day-zero synthesis, never-silently-overwrite, seed mode, and a
  documented v1→v2 reshaping.
- **Enforcement** ([`06c`](06c-the-enforcement-reader.md)) — `design-system.mjs`
  folds the memory into an allowed set (every `canonical` + every `tonalRamp` stop)
  and flags any color/font/radius in code that drifts off it **within a tolerance**;
  the live server merges it with the parsed prose for the panel.
- **The conditioner** ([`06c`](06c-the-enforcement-reader.md) §5) — a single
  `Register` value (`brand` | `product`) flips the downstream motion doctrine, so
  the same measured 1200ms reveal reads as "the point" (brand) or "a bug" (product).

```mermaid

  style ENF fill:#1a1a2e,color:#eee
```

The whole loop is **authored**: a model writes the tokens, the reader enforces code
against them, a staleness signal tells the model when to re-author. YoinkIt's
inversion keeps the loop and replaces the core — the tokens come from measurement,
and "off-system" means "unlike what the site actually does."

---

## 2. The motion block, in the context that makes it legible

The survey's stop-you-in-your-tracks quote is the entire `extensions.motion` of
Impeccable's own design system ([`design.json:226-232`](../../source/.impeccable/design.json)):

```json
"motion": [
  {
    "name": "ks-ease",
    "value": "cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1)",
    "purpose": "Default kit easing for color, border, and transform transitions."
  }
]
```

Read in isolation this looks like a motion schema. Read in context
([`06a`](06a-the-persisted-artifact.md) §3) it is **one `{name, value, purpose}`
row** in a token-metadata family — identical in shape to `shadows`, one of six
sibling blocks — carrying a *single easing curve* and **no duration**. The duration
of Impeccable's actual hover transitions (180ms) lives inline in `components[].css`
(`:285`), not in the motion token. So the authored artifact tokenises the *curve*
(reusable) and leaves the *duration* uncaptured.

That asymmetry is the report's hinge. A **measured** memory has the opposite
pressure: YoinkIt measures duration cleanly first and most often *cannot* read
easing (rAF/JS-driven motion yields `easing: "unknown (rAF/JS) — verify"`,
[`capture-animation.js:666-667`](../../../../extension/capture-animation.js)). So
YoinkIt's `motion.json` inverts the emphasis — duration and per-layer timeline are
first-class measured fields, easing carries a confidence marker — while keeping the
`{name, value, purpose}` row as the interop seam back to Impeccable
([`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) §4-5).

---

## 3. The mechanism worth stealing: memory as a tolerance-gated linter

`design-system.mjs` is the proof that "memory is an enforcement contract, not
passive docs" ([`06c`](06c-the-enforcement-reader.md)). It reads the sidecar's
`colorMeta` — **every** `canonical` and **every** `tonalRamp` stop — into an
allowed-color set ([`design-system.mjs:260-273`](../../source/cli/engine/design-system.mjs)),
and flags any color in code that is not **within `COLOR_CHANNEL_TOLERANCE = 6`
channels** of an allowed color ([`:396-408`](../../source/cli/engine/design-system.mjs)),
emitting a `design-system-color` finding the hook surfaces on every edit. Radii get
the same treatment within `RADIUS_TOLERANCE_PX = 0.5`. Colors compare **as parsed
values, not strings**, on both the allow side and the dedup side
([`:681-702`](../../source/cli/engine/design-system.mjs)).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph IMP["IMPECCABLE — authored ideal"]
    M1["design.json.extensions.colorMeta\ncanonical + tonalRamp[]"]
    M1 --> S1["allowedColorKeys (Map)"]
    S1 --> F1["flag code color NOT within\nCOLOR_CHANNEL_TOLERANCE=6\n→ design-system-color"]
  end
  subgraph YOI["YOINKIT — measured norm"]
    M2["motion.json.tokens\neasings[] + durations[]"]
    M2 --> S2["allowedEasings / allowedDurations"]
    S2 --> F2["flag new capture/recreation easing\nNOT within EASE_TOLERANCE\n→ motion-off-easing"]
  end
  F1 -. same mechanism .-> F2
  style F1 fill:#1a1a2e,color:#eee
  style F2 fill:#0f3460,color:#eee
```

YoinkIt's `motion.json` linter ([`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) §7) is
this file with the **truth-source inverted**: read the site's measured easing /
duration vocabulary into an allowed set, flag a new capture or a recreation whose
motion drifts off it within an easing/duration tolerance, weighted by `confidence`
and `register`. The data structure is identical; "off-system" flips from "unlike the
authored ideal" to "unlike what the site empirically does." That single inversion is
the whole product idea: **a capture tool that also lints motion consistency.**

---

## 4. The payoff in one screen: `__cap.dump()` → `.yoinkit/motion.json`

[`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) writes the schema out in full; the
correspondence at a glance:

| Impeccable `design.json` (authored) | YoinkIt `motion.json` (measured) | Inversion |
|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` / `generatedAt` / `title` | same | **ADOPT** the frame verbatim |
| `extensions.motion[] = {name,value,purpose}` | `tokens.easings[]/durations[] = {name,value,purpose, confidence, observedIn}` | extend the interop row with measured fields |
| LLM authors tokens (`/impeccable document`) | the **fold**: a pure fn of `__cap.dump()` | **drop** authoring; no value is invented |
| `narrative` (LLM intent prose) | `narrative` from human **Notes** (`CONTEXT.md:248`) | same slot, opposite origin |
| `Register` brand/product (whole-site, authored) | `register` signature/incidental (per-motion, from `importance`) | YoinkIt's native axis |
| `design-system.mjs` flags off-**authored**-ideal | motion linter flags off-**measured**-norm | same mechanism, truth-source inverted |
| day-zero **synthesize** a default token | **never** — coverage shows thinness | the catch |
| `mdNewerThanJson` (memory lags source) | `sourceChangedSinceCapture` (re-capture, can't re-author) | reader heuristic, reframed |

A `motion.json` token is a valid `extensions.motion` row, so a YoinkIt capture can
**seed an Impeccable motion block with measured tokens** — the one thing
Impeccable's generation path cannot produce. The reverse imports as `confidence:
"unknown"`. That asymmetry is the inversion enforced in a single field
([`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) §5).

---

## 5. Patterns for YoinkIt

Ranked by leverage for building the measured motion memory. Each is expanded in the
named sub-dive, with tags matching the survey's scheme (**ADOPT** a pattern/schema,
**EXPLORE** worth prototyping, **INSPIRATION** a stance).

1. **The durable artifact — ADOPT.** A committed, `schemaVersion`/`generatedAt`-
   stamped `.yoinkit/motion.json` (`tokens` + `motions` by Region + `narrative` +
   `coverage`) replacing N throwaway gitignored `*.animation.json`. The single
   highest-value move; it is the *object* YoinkIt lacks.
   *([`06a`](06a-the-persisted-artifact.md), [`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) §3)*

2. **The fold (`__cap.dump()` → memory) — ADOPT.** A pure function from a capture
   spec + existing memory to a new memory. No authoring step exists in it; that is
   what keeps the object measured. *([`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) §4)*

3. **The motion-consistency linter — ADOPT (truth-source inverted).** `design-system.mjs`'s
   allowed-set + tolerance-flag mechanism, reading the site's measured easing/duration
   vocabulary and flagging new motion off it (`motion-off-easing/-duration`), weighted
   by confidence and register. *([`06c`](06c-the-enforcement-reader.md) §2-3, [`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) §7)*

4. **The `{name,value,purpose}` interop seam — ADOPT.** Measured tokens that are
   valid `extensions.motion` rows, so a YoinkIt capture can seed an Impeccable motion
   block (one direction; reverse imports as `confidence: unknown`).
   *([`06a`](06a-the-persisted-artifact.md) §3d, [`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) §5)*

5. **The lifecycle disciplines — ADOPT.** Stamp versions, never silently overwrite,
   ship a thin memory that commits to enrichment (seed mode), track staleness as a
   reader-side mtime/hash heuristic. All inversion-safe.
   *([`06b`](06b-generation-and-migration.md) §1-2, §4)*

6. **The motion `narrative` — EXPLORE.** Pair measured tokens with human-intent prose
   from Notes (not an LLM), so the memory says what is load-bearing.
   *([`06a`](06a-the-persisted-artifact.md) §5, [`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) §5)*

7. **The per-motion `register` tag — EXPLORE.** `signature`/`incidental` (preserve vs
   normalise), mapped from YoinkIt's `importance` enum, with an optional coarse
   brand/product `siteRegister` fallback. *([`06c`](06c-the-enforcement-reader.md) §5, [`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) §6)*

8. **The motion panel + URL lab — EXPLORE (Territory 3 seam).** The live-merge
   contract gives a panel that renders captured timelines beside human Notes.
   *([`06c`](06c-the-enforcement-reader.md) §4, [`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) §8)*

9. **Confidence as the spine; coverage shows thinness; never synthesize —
   INSPIRATION.** The disciplines that keep an accumulating measured memory from
   decaying into an authored one. The catch, made structural.
   *([`06b`](06b-generation-and-migration.md) §2, [`06d`](06d-a-motion-json-for-yoinkit.md) §9)*

## Appendix: surprises / risks / drift

- **`.impeccable/` is three tracked files.** `git ls-files` returns `config.json`,
  `design.json`, `live/config.json` — a multi-concern committed store. The survey's
  one-file framing undersells the directory. (06a §1)
- **A v1 `design.json` reads as empty, not migrated.** No reader branches on
  `schemaVersion` ([`design-system.mjs`](../../source/cli/engine/design-system.mjs)
  has none; [`live-server.mjs:545`](../../source/skill/scripts/live-server.mjs) only a
  comment). The "migratable schema" is migratable by **regeneration**, which YoinkIt
  cannot do (it must re-measure) — so a YoinkIt reader must fail *visible*, not
  *silent-empty*. (06b §3)
- **`mdNewerThanJson` lives in two readers with no shared helper.** Computed
  identically at [`design-system.mjs:386`](../../source/cli/engine/design-system.mjs)
  and [`live-server.mjs:574`](../../source/skill/scripts/live-server.mjs) — the
  hand-sync hazard [`05c`](../05-hook-system/05c-config-and-ignore-model.md) §5 warns
  about, here in the design-memory slice. (06b §4, 06c §4)
- **The schema is loose: real ≠ demo ≠ spec.** The real artifact, the worked-example
  demo, and the `document.md` schema disagree on `description`, `roundedMeta`,
  `shadows` emptiness, and `motion[].duration`. The reader tolerates it (every block
  guarded by `typeof`), which is a feature to copy and a precision trap for anyone
  citing "the schema." (06a §6)
- **Fonts are enforced from the prose frontmatter, colors/radii from the sidecar.**
  The allowed-font axis reads `frontmatter.typography`
  ([`design-system.mjs:275`](../../source/cli/engine/design-system.mjs)), not
  `typographyMeta`. Enforcement reads **both halves** of the memory, which is why the
  panel must merge them. (06c §2)
- **The motion token is curve-only; the duration is uncaptured.** `ks-ease` is a
  curve referenced at 180ms in component CSS (`design.json:285`); the token has no
  duration. The authored artifact's blind spot (uncaptured timing) is exactly the
  measured memory's strength. (06a §3d)
- **The `Register` field is a fallback, not a switch.** Task cue → surface → field,
  first match wins (`source/CLAUDE.md`). The "one-field conditioner" holds only when
  the first two are absent or agree. (06c §5)
- **The richest motion vocabulary YoinkIt ever wrote is archived.** The concrete
  `animations.json` field set (`tokens`, `patterns`, `lead{from,to,duration,ease,
  easeBezier}`, `confidence`, `timelineRef`) lives in
  `docs/archive/legacy-capture-pipeline/SPEC.md:143-181`, demoted by `CLAUDE.md` to
  historical. The `motion.json` proposal re-grounds it on the *current* `__cap.dump()`
  output and the place-first page model. (06d §1, §3)

# Impeccable Live Mode — Deep Technical Audit

**Subsystem:** "live variant mode" — the local-server collaboration loop and the
in-page overlay / manual-edit round-trip. A human points at an element on their
own running dev server, picks a design action, and an AI agent hot-swaps real
HTML+CSS variants into the source; the human cycles, tunes, accepts. A second,
parallel loop lets the human edit copy directly in the page and have an agent
write it back to source. **Audience:** the YoinkIt team. Everything is framed
toward what a capture tool whose engine (`window.__cap`) injects into arbitrary
pages and collaborates with an agent about them can lift, adapt, or must avoid.

This is the audit's **crown jewel**. Impeccable independently built the thing
YoinkIt's product model wants: an async human↔agent-in-the-browser loop, made
crash-recoverable, shipped with zero dependencies, portable across every agent
harness. The headline lessons are (1) a **long-poll + leased-event transport**
that needs no harness-specific glue, (2) an **append-only session journal** that
makes the loop survive a killed agent or a reloaded browser, (3) a
**self-stabilizing dual locator** that re-resolves a picked element across HMR
reloads, and (4) a **redundancy-plus-server-verification** posture that treats
the writing agent as untrusted.

All source paths are under `../../source/` (i.e. `audit/impeccable/source/`).

> **Deep dives.** This report is the overview and owns the orientation. Six

> The first pass split this subsystem across two parallel drafts
> (`03-live-mode-orchestration.md` for the server, `04-live-mode-manual-edits.md`
> for the overlay) for readability; it is **one** system, re-derived here from
> source along its real seams:
>
> - [`03a-server-transport-and-protocol.md`](03a-server-transport-and-protocol.md): the zero-dependency Node server — every route, the SSE fan-out, the `/poll` long-poll + **event lease**, the `agent_polling` presence beacon, the secrets-prepended `/live.js` handshake, exit hysteresis, the single-instance PID lock, the 270s slice client, inbound validation, and the single-source verb vocabulary. **The wire both round-trips ride on.**
> - [`03b-session-journal-and-recovery.md`](03b-session-journal-and-recovery.md): the append-only JSONL journal, the snapshot **fold**, the phase machine, durability-as-precondition, restart requeue, and the `resume`/`status`/`complete` recovery printers. **The durable spine under the variant loop.**
> - [`03c-variant-lifecycle-and-carbonize.md`](03c-variant-lifecycle-and-carbonize.md): the variant lifecycle traced across all three parties — pick → `generate` → `wrap` → write N variants → cycle → **inline accept** → the **carbonize two-phase commit**. **The agent-driven seam.**
> - [`03d-overlay-picker-and-locators.md`](03d-overlay-picker-and-locators.md): the 11k-line in-page overlay — injection + isolation (namespace tier vs shadow DOM), the capture-phase element picker, the three selector flavors, and the **id-decisive dual-locator re-resolution** under HMR, plus the variant-cycling/param UI. **The `pick()` / `on(sel)` analog.**
> - [`03e-manual-edit-round-trip.md`](03e-manual-edit-round-trip.md): the second, parallel loop — inline copy editor → buffer (merge-by-ref keeping the original text) → multi-strategy **evidence** → a manual Apply backend, either the active chat poll agent or a spawned codex/claude subprocess → server-side **verification + rollback + repair**. **The untrusted-agent write-back loop.**
> - [`03f-framework-source-mapping.md`](03f-framework-source-mapping.md): the shared hard case — mapping a live DOM element back to source when a framework renders text from expressions (`{count} seats`). The Svelte prop contract, the literal↔expression text map, anchor re-resolution, and the Astro source hint. **The machinery both loops lean on.**
>
> **Corrections to the first drafts and the ADR, up front** (each verified
> against `../../source/`; the sub-dives flag more inline):
>
> - **The ADR is stale on accept.** [`adr-live-variant-mode.md`](../../source/docs/adr-live-variant-mode.md) is dated 2026-04-12 and shows accept as a flat `{type:"done"}` reply (`:153`). The shipped protocol routes accept through a **completion type** — `complete` (terminal now) vs `agent_done` + `requiresComplete:true` (carbonize cleanup owed) — decided in [`completion.mjs`](../../source/skill/scripts/live/completion.mjs). The whole "carbonize" two-phase commit postdates the ADR. See [`03c`](03c-variant-lifecycle-and-carbonize.md).
> - **`live-wrap.mjs` (894 lines) was missing from draft 03's file map** yet is the entire "wrap" half of the 40s→15-20s latency win and a required step in every generate. Restored in the master map below and in [`03c`](03c-variant-lifecycle-and-carbonize.md).
> - **The session "state machine" is an event-sourced fold, not a guarded FSM.** `applyEvent` ([`session-store.mjs:155`](../../source/skill/scripts/live/session-store.mjs)) sets each event type's phase **unconditionally**; the *only* guarded event is `checkpoint` (monotonic via `checkpointRevision`, ignored after a terminal phase). Draft 03's clean `stateDiagram` overstates the enforced invariants. `baseSnapshot` also carries `deliveryLease` and `activeOwner` (draft omitted both), and the fields are `pendingEvent` + `pendingEventSeq` (two keys). See [`03b`](03b-session-journal-and-recovery.md).
> - **Two line-number fixes that matter:** `VISUAL_ACTIONS` is at [`vocabulary.mjs:36`](../../source/skill/scripts/live/vocabulary.mjs) (the `.map()` derivation), not `:20` (that is `LIVE_COMMANDS`); the agent poll-loop pseudocode is under the **"Poll loop"** heading at [`live.md:46`](../../source/skill/reference/live.md), not `:51-63`. `live-browser-dom.js` is **146** lines, not 147.
> - **The manual-edit loop is a different machine.** It does **not** use browser `/events` journaling: `/events` POST *rejects* `manual_edits` and `manual_edit_apply` ([`live-server.mjs:673,678`](../../source/skill/scripts/live-server.mjs)). The loop uses its own `/manual-edit-*` routes and JSON **buffer**. Apply can run through the active chat poll agent (`manual_edit_apply`) or fall back to a spawned `codex`/`claude` subprocess; either way, the server verifies and repairs/rolls back the result. This seam is traced in §4. See [`03e`](03e-manual-edit-round-trip.md).

## 1. Orientation: three parties, two round-trips

Live mode bridges **three parties that never share a process**:

- a **browser** — the user's *own* running dev-server page, into which a single
  ~11k-line script (`/live.js`) is injected. It builds a floating overlay: a
  global bar, an element picker, a contextual action bar that morphs through
  `configure → generating → cycling → saving → confirmed`, a variant cycler with
  per-variant parameter knobs, and an inline copy editor.
- a zero-dependency **local Node server** (`live-server.mjs`) on
  `127.0.0.1:8400+`, written against only `http`, `crypto`, `fs`, `net`, `os` —
  no `npm install`, because it ships *inside* the skill directory.
- an **agent** — any AI harness that can run a shell command and read stdout.
  No harness-specific integration: that portability is the load-bearing
  architectural bet ([`adr:39-40`](../../source/docs/adr-live-variant-mode.md)).

The two edges use deliberately asymmetric transports. **Browser↔server** is
**Server-Sent Events (server→browser push) + fetch POST (browser→server)** —
chosen over WebSocket precisely to delete the `ws` dependency
([`adr:27-28`](../../source/docs/adr-live-variant-mode.md)). **Agent↔server** is
**HTTP long-poll (`GET /poll` blocks until an event) + POST reply** — chosen so
the agent needs nothing but a shell.

```

On top of that wire run **two distinct round-trips** that share the transport
but almost nothing else:

| | **Variant loop** (the crown jewel) | **Manual-edit loop** |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | pick element → action → Go | double-click "Edit copy" → type → Save → Apply |
| Browser→server route | `POST /events {generate}` | `POST /manual-edit-stash` then `/manual-edit-commit` |
| Agent model | the **harness poll agent** (long-poll loop) | an existing chat poll agent when active, otherwise a spawned `codex`/`claude` subprocess |
| Durable state | append-only **session journal** (03b) | a project-local **JSON buffer** (03e) |
| Output | N variants written to source; one accepted + carbonized | each copy edit written back to source, verified |
| Trust posture | agent drives its own edits | agent treated as **untrusted**: server verifies + rolls back |
| Sub-dives | 03a · 03b · 03c (+ 03d picker, 03f frameworks) | 03e (+ 03d editor, 03f frameworks) |

Holding the difference between these two loops is the single most important thing
for reading the code without confusion: the same `live-server.mjs` hosts both,
but `manual_edits` is explicitly *refused* on the journaled `/events` path and
shunted to its own buffered routes.

### The inversion you must hold (same shape, opposite physics)

Impeccable and YoinkIt look like the same product and are built on opposite
physics. Reading the live-mode code without this framing leads to copying the
wrong half.

- **Impeccable writes code into the user's real source and leans on HMR.** Its
  agent *owns the repo and the dev server*. "Accept a variant" reduces to "the
  winner is already in the file; delete the losers"
  ([`adr:21-26`](../../source/docs/adr-live-variant-mode.md)). YoinkIt emits a
  spec and deliberately refuses to write code, so that mechanic does **not**
  transfer. What transfers is the *state machine* around it (instant draft →
  gated finalize), not the file-writing.
- **The bottlenecks are inverted.** YoinkIt's hard problem is the browser:
  headless will not fire framework motion handlers, so capture must run in a
  real visible tab. Impeccable's "capture" is trivial — it reads `outerHTML` and
  computed styles from an overlay it already injected. What it engineers around
  is **agent round-trip latency** (~40s → 15-20s via a `wrap` helper and batched
  writes, [`adr:242-250`](../../source/docs/adr-live-variant-mode.md)). So when
  Impeccable optimizes, it optimizes a problem YoinkIt does not have, and takes
  for granted the problem YoinkIt does.

Every "pattern to steal" below is read through that lens, and tagged
**STEAL** (transfers almost directly) / **ADAPT** (idea transfers, mechanism must
change) / **AVOID** (rests on an assumption YoinkIt does not share), the
convention from [`PATTERNS-FOR-YOINKIT.md`](../../PATTERNS-FOR-YOINKIT.md).

## 3. The lifecycle at a glance

The canonical variant cycle, agent ↔ server ↔ browser ↔ human, end to end. The
sub-dives expand each band: the wire is 03a, the journaling is 03b, the
agent-side work and carbonize are 03c, the picker/cycler is 03d.

```mermaid

```

## 4. The seams (where the parts meet)

The sub-dives each own one organ; the system's behavior lives in how they
connect. Five seams matter.

### 4.1 The handshake seam: the server *builds* the overlay (03a → 03d)

The browser script is never a static file. `/live.js` is assembled per request
by `assembleLiveBrowserScript`
([`browser-script-parts.mjs:35`](../../source/skill/scripts/live/browser-script-parts.mjs)),
which concatenates three parts — `live-browser-session.js`,
`live-browser-dom.js`, `live-browser.js` — behind a **three-line prelude that is
the entire handshake**:

```js
// browser-script-parts.mjs:36
const prelude =
  `window.__IMPECCABLE_TOKEN__ = '${token}';\n` +
  `window.__IMPECCABLE_PORT__ = ${port};\n` +
  `window.__IMPECCABLE_VOCAB__ = ${JSON.stringify(vocabulary)};\n`;
```

The browser never negotiates a token or fetches config; the server hands it the
secrets *prepended to the code it serves*, and every later request carries the
token. This is where 03a (the server) physically produces 03d (the overlay), and
it is the pattern YoinkIt should copy to serve `capture-animation.js` with a
collector URL + token instead of the clipboard / `window.__capLast` dance.

### 4.2 The divergence seam: two round-trips, two agent models

The same `POST` surface forks hard. The journaled `/events` path is for the
variant loop only; it **explicitly refuses** manual edits and shunts them to a
separate machine:

```js
// live-server.mjs (the /events POST handler)
//  :673  manual_edits        → 400 "must POST to /manual-edit-stash, not /events"
//  :678  manual_edit_apply   → 400 "disabled; use /manual-edit-stash then /manual-edit-commit"
```

So there are **two agent-invocation models** in one subsystem:

- the **variant loop** is driven by the *harness poll agent* — the same Claude
  Code / Codex / Cursor process that ran `live.mjs`, parked on `GET /poll`. It
  edits source with its own tools and journals through the session store (03b).
- the **manual-edit loop** uses the manual-edit routes/buffer and then chooses an
  Apply backend. In chat mode, or auto mode when an active chat agent is likely,
  it dispatches a server-created `manual_edit_apply` event to the poll loop; in
  subprocess mode, `live-copy-edit-agent.mjs` launches `codex
  --dangerously-bypass-…` or `claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions`
  ([`live-copy-edit-agent.mjs`](../../source/skill/scripts/live-copy-edit-agent.mjs)).
  Both receive a strict-JSON batch and are treated as **untrusted**: the server
  verifies the result landed, rolls back partials, and repairs. Its durable state is the JSON
  buffer, not the journal.

A fresh reader who assumes "the agent" is one thing will mis-trace half the
code. They are two agents with two trust models. See [`03e`](03e-manual-edit-round-trip.md).

### 4.3 The durability seam: append before you act (03b under 03a/03c)

Every browser intent is journaled **before** it is enqueued for the agent. The
`/events` POST handler appends to the session store first and fails the whole
request with a 500 if that write fails — durability is a precondition, not
best-effort:

```js
// live-server.mjs (browser→server POST), abridged
const error = validateEvent(msg);
if (error) { res.writeHead(400, …); return; }
if (state.sessionStore && msg.id) {
  try { state.sessionStore.appendEvent(msg); }   // durable FIRST
  catch (err) { res.writeHead(500, …); return; } // refuse if journal write fails
}
if (msg.type !== 'checkpoint') enqueueEvent(msg); // checkpoints are journal-only
```

The snapshot is a *fold* over the journal; on boot the server re-enqueues every
snapshot's pending event so a restart never asks the human to click Go again.
Note the asymmetry the sub-dive surfaces: the *inbound* path is a hard 500
precondition, but the *agent reply* journaling is best-effort (caught, no 500)
and terminal-safe — a deliberate split. See [`03b`](03b-session-journal-and-recovery.md).

### 4.4 The inline-accept seam (03c across 03a/03b)

The subtlest moment in the whole system: when the human clicks Accept, the file
work happens **inside the poll**, before the agent reads the event.
`augmentEventWithAcceptHandling`
([`live-poll.mjs:182`](../../source/skill/scripts/live-poll.mjs)) runs
`live-accept.mjs` via `execFileSync`, parses the result, posts the completion
reply, and only then hands the event to the agent. So by the time the agent
"sees" an accept, the deterministic file rewrite and the browser DOM update are
already done; the agent's only remaining job is carbonize cleanup *if*
`completion.mjs` said so. This is what couples the instant-feedback path and the
correctness path through durable state rather than through ordering. See
[`03c`](03c-variant-lifecycle-and-carbonize.md).

### 4.5 The shared-machinery seam: frameworks and the vocabulary (03f, 03a)

Two pieces are shared by *both* loops:

- **Framework source mapping (03f).** Both "accept a variant" and "write a copy
  edit back" hit the same wall when the page is a component framework: the live
  DOM shows rendered text, but source authored it from an expression
  (`{count} seats`). The Svelte adapter holds the bidirectional contract; the
  Astro `data-astro-source-*` hint gives a precise-when-present location. A sharp
  correction lives here: Svelte variants live in
  `node_modules/.impeccable-live/<id>/` during preview; on accept, the chosen
  variant is spliced into the route source and the temp session is removed.
  **Carbonize is always `false` for it** because no plain-DOM wrapper or
  carbonize marker remains in source — it diverges from the plain-DOM accept in 03c.
- **The single-source vocabulary (03a).** The 12 design verbs live once in
  [`vocabulary.mjs`](../../source/skill/scripts/live/vocabulary.mjs) and feed
  three consumers — the server validator, the browser picker (serialized into
  `window.__IMPECCABLE_VOCAB__`), and the marketing site. Add or reorder a verb
  in one place and all three follow.

## 5. Patterns worth stealing for YoinkIt (ranked)

Full reasoning, file:line refs, and YoinkIt applications are in each sub-dive's
own "Patterns worth stealing" section. The ranked summary:

1. **Long-poll + event lease as the harness-agnostic agent transport.** `GET
   /poll` parks until a human acts; events are *leased* (default 600s), not
   removed, until the agent replies, so a re-poll never double-delivers and a
   dead agent's lease expires and self-heals the event back into the queue.
   *YoinkIt:* the missing wire to let any agent wait for a human to pick an
   element or trigger a capture without blocking the chat. **STEAL.** → [`03a`](03a-server-transport-and-protocol.md).
2. **Append-only journal + snapshot fold + a `resume` that prints the next
   action.** Every intent is journaled before it is acted on; a restart requeues
   in-flight work; recovery prints the exact next safe command. *YoinkIt:* a
   `.yoinkit/sessions/<id>.jsonl` journal makes a long multi-source,
   multi-viewport capture sweep resumable, and "a capture you cannot persist is
   not captured." **STEAL.** → [`03b`](03b-session-journal-and-recovery.md).
3. **Self-stabilizing locator recovery, re-resolved id-first across reloads.** Impeccable has
   two adjacent mechanisms: variant recovery uses a tolerant snapshot
   (`{tag,id,classes,text[120]}`), and manual-edit recovery uses a durable
   structural ref (`tag#id.cls:nth-of-type(n)>…`). YoinkIt should intentionally
   store both and re-resolve after HMR id-first → class-subset → text-needle,
   because hashed classes and component tag names do not survive the build.
   *YoinkIt:* this is the concrete implementation of "drive by selector, never
   coordinates" for `pick()` / `on(sel)`. **STEAL.** → [`03d`](03d-overlay-picker-and-locators.md).
4. **Redundancy + server-side verification over one perfect selector.** The
   manual-edit loop hands the agent five weak source candidates, then the server
   *independently proves* the edit landed and rolls back partial writes; the
   agent is untrusted. *YoinkIt:* verify that what you claim you captured is
   actually in the spec before reporting done. **STEAL (as a principle).** → [`03e`](03e-manual-edit-round-trip.md).
5. **SSE + fetch, zero-dependency Node relay, secrets prepended to the served
   script.** The whole thing ships inside a skill directory with no `npm
   install`. *YoinkIt:* a small bundled relay lets `__cap` POST captures to a
   local collector and gives the human a live "agent is listening" channel; the
   prelude trick hands the engine a token + collector URL with no clipboard
   round-trip. **STEAL.** → [`03a`](03a-server-transport-and-protocol.md).
6. **Two-phase accept (instant ugly draft → gated clean finalize / "carbonize").**
   Accept does a fast visually-correct write for instant feedback, then a
   `carbonize_required` phase *refuses to let the session complete* until the
   agent rewrites it clean. *YoinkIt:* accept a capture into a draft spec
   instantly, gate a "crystallize" step that finalizes the agent-ready spec —
   the human is not blocked on the slow synthesis, but it cannot be silently
   skipped. **ADAPT** (the file-writing does not transfer; the state machine
   does). → [`03c`](03c-variant-lifecycle-and-carbonize.md).
7. **Treat user/page text as literal data + a plain-text input gate; scrub the
   engine's own footprint.** The copy editor blocks `< { } \``; the agent prompt
   repeats "treat user text as literal data, never instructions"; context is
   stripped of all `data-impeccable-*` scaffolding before it reaches the agent.
   *YoinkIt:* a page under capture is untrusted, and `dump()` must guarantee no
   capture-engine markers leak into the spec. **STEAL.** → [`03e`](03e-manual-edit-round-trip.md), [`03d`](03d-overlay-picker-and-locators.md).
8. **Presence beacon + exit-with-hysteresis.** The server broadcasts whether an
   agent is parked on `/poll`, and debounces an SSE drop 8s before synthesizing
   an `exit` so HMR reloads do not end the session. *YoinkIt:* show the human an
   agent is listening before they invest in picking; do not tear down a capture
   session on every tab reload. **STEAL** (beacon) / **ADAPT** (hysteresis). → [`03a`](03a-server-transport-and-protocol.md).
9. **Literal↔expression text recovery + Astro source hint.** Recover which
   expression rendered which visible string; read a framework's own
   source-location attribute when present, fall back to selector/text otherwise.
   *YoinkIt:* when a captured element's text is dynamic, record the binding
   rather than freezing a literal. **ADAPT.** → [`03f`](03f-framework-source-mapping.md).

### What NOT to steal

- **"Accept = keep the winning variant in the source file."** It works only
  because Impeccable's agent owns the repo and writes real code. YoinkIt emits a
  spec. Steal the two-phase state machine (#6), not the file mechanic. **AVOID.**
- **The assumption that capture is free.** Impeccable reads `outerHTML` from an
  overlay it already injected; YoinkIt's whole difficulty is getting a real
  visible browser to fire framework motion. Do not let the relaxed capture code
  suggest the problem is easy. **AVOID as a mindset.**
- **Optimizing agent round-trip latency first.** Impeccable's `wrap` helper and
  batched writes target a bottleneck YoinkIt does not have yet; YoinkIt's
  bottleneck is rendering fidelity in a real browser. **AVOID as a priority.**
- **Writing variants back into route source.** The framework write-back (03f) is
  an AVOID; steal the mapping, not the write. **AVOID.**

## 6. Surprises / where this contradicts the map→capture model

- **The expensive, fragile half (capture/render) is here the *cheap* half.**
  YoinkIt's core thesis is that motion capture needs a real visible browser.
  Impeccable's "capture" is `element.outerHTML` + computed styles from an
  already-injected overlay; the hard part it engineers around is the agent's
  round-trip latency. The two tools optimize opposite bottlenecks: YoinkIt
  fights the browser, Impeccable fights the agent loop.
- **One subsystem, two Apply paths, two trust models.** The variant loop trusts
  its poll agent; the manual-edit loop either dispatches server-created chat
  Apply work to the poll agent or spawns a subprocess, then verifies after the
  fact. The "agent" is not one thing.
- **The journal is a fold, not a guarded machine.** Most events set their phase
  unconditionally; only checkpoints are guarded (monotonic + terminal-safe).
  Robustness comes from *re-derivability* (replay the journal) and *durability*
  (append before act), not from rejecting illegal transitions. This is a
  different and cheaper kind of correctness than a validated FSM.
- **"Single generation at a time, no cancel mid-generate"**
  ([`adr:257-261`](../../source/docs/adr-live-variant-mode.md)) because the
  source file can hold only one variant wrapper. YoinkIt's capture is likewise a
  one-shot timed recipe (settle → arm → trigger → wait → dump) you do not
  interrupt — the same "arming mid-transition captures nothing" constraint,
  reached from the opposite direction.
- **Exit is inferred, not just commanded.** Closing the tab is not an explicit
  stop; the server debounces the SSE drop for 8s to survive HMR reloads, then
  synthesizes `exit`. Any async loop where the human can simply walk away needs
  presence-with-hysteresis rather than a hard disconnect.
- **The overlay exposes no clean public API.** Unlike `__cap.on/scan/dump`, the
  ~11k-line overlay keeps ~490 functions closure-private behind a single
  `__IMPECCABLE_LIVE_CHROME_CORE__` debug surface — far less scriptable from
  automation. A point in YoinkIt's favor, and a reminder that a small, named
  engine API is itself an asset. See [`03d`](03d-overlay-picker-and-locators.md).

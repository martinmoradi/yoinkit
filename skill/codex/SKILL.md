  Yoink what a live web page's animations ACTUALLY do — sampled per frame by
  the engine and emitted as an agent-ready SPEC (libraries, per-layer
  timing/easing, frame timelines), never code. Run ONLY when the user explicitly
  invokes /yoinkit, with either a URL (yoink the whole page) or a
  request about a specific page's motion (yoink the targeted animation). This
  is a heavy, real-browser-driving pipeline: do NOT trigger it for general
  questions about CSS or animation, how to animate something, GSAP/ScrollTrigger
  usage, recommending a library, or reviewing existing animation code — none of
  those are yoinking requests. No auto-trigger from keywords; explicit
  /yoinkit invocation only.

# YoinkIt

Yoink a live page's motion into **yoinked motion**, an agent-ready spec — libraries, a
summary, per-layer timing/easing, and per-frame timelines — that a *coding* agent
later rebuilds from. The spec is the product; this skill never emits recreation
code.

## Compatibility

Run from the YoinkIt repo root. Needs Bun and agent-browser; the tool
self-drives a real headed browser via `bin/capture-browser`.

For repair diagnosis, use a Codex multi-agent/subagent tool when one is available
(discover it with `tool_search` if needed), launching at most 6 diagnosis
workers at once. The coordinator batches up to 10 capture inputs per wave, with
3 captures per worker, so 10 repair inputs should produce about 4 worker prompts.
Queue overflow in later batches, or run the same diagnosis prompts serially in
the current agent if no subagent tool is available. Always save the same output
JSON files before applying repairs.

## The one rule that shapes everything: script measures, agent judges

`extension/capture-animation.js` (via `bin/yoinkit`) is the **sole
measurement instrument**. Every duration, easing, from/to value, frame count, and
`ok/check/empty/error` status comes from the engine's per-frame sampling — never
from a model.

This skill and its subagents decide **what** to capture, **how** to reach it, and
how to **repair** a failed capture. They never measure motion. The repair
diagnosis subagent's output schema has no measurement fields, and every repair is
**re-measured by the engine**; success is machine-checked against engine output,
not self-reported. If any step would route a measured number through a model, that
step is wrong — fix it, don't ship it.

This is also why capture needs a **real, visible browser**: headless/synthetic
events don't fire framework hover/scroll handlers (Webflow IX2, GSAP) and the
headless compositor may not advance transitions. The tool already opens headed via
`bin/capture-browser`; just run it from the repo root.

## Input routing (do this first)

Look at what the user passed to `/yoinkit`:

- **A URL** (e.g. `https://example.com/`) → **whole-page** scope. Yoink every
  animation the planner proposes.
- **A natural-language request about a page** (e.g. "help me understand the hero
  animation on example.com", "what's the card hover on acme.dev/work") →
  **targeted** scope. Resolve the URL from the text, map the page, then reason over
  the map to focus capture + the report on the animation(s) the user asked about.

If no URL is present or resolvable, ask the user for one. Don't guess a URL.

## The pipeline

Run these stages in order, from the repo root. Replace `<url>` and use the printed
run dir. Heavy artifacts land under `runs/` (gitignored) — never commit them.

### 1–3. Map + plan (structure, stack, selectors, proposed captures)

```bash
./bin/yoinkit scout "<url>" --viewport 1280x800
```

This writes `map.json` (libraries, ScrollTriggers, hover candidates, split
reveals), `manifest.proposed.json` (the proposed capture manifest), and
`capture-plan.md`. Note the **run dir** it prints (`Run: runs/...`).

- **Whole-page:** use `manifest.proposed.json` as-is.
- **Targeted:** read `map.json` + `manifest.proposed.json` and pick the
  capture(s) that match the user's target. Reason over the map — match by
  section, selector, group, or capture `id` (e.g. a "hero" request → the
  `boot`/`load` reveal and the hero section's captures; a named hover → the
  hover capture whose `root` is under that component). Write a filtered manifest:

  ```bash
  bun skill/codex/scripts/filter-manifest.js \
    --in <run>/manifest.proposed.json --out <run>/manifest.targeted.json \
    --ids "hero-load,hero-headline-reveal"      # or --grep "hero|headline"
  ```

  Use `manifest.targeted.json` in the next step. If the target is ambiguous,
  briefly tell the user which captures you selected and why.

### 4. Capture (real headed browser) + dump diagnosis inputs

```bash
./bin/yoinkit capture <run> <run>/manifest.proposed.json --repair-dump
```

(Use `manifest.targeted.json` for a targeted run.) The engine samples each
capture per frame and **soft-fails** the rest, recording a structured `cause`.
`--repair-dump` additionally writes, for each repairable soft-fail
(`occlusion` / `hidden_not_visible` / `inert_representative`), a §2 diagnosis
input + a viewport screenshot under `<run>/repair/<id>.attempt-1.input.json`. It
runs **no** provider and re-measures nothing — it just stages the inputs so you
can diagnose failures in parallel next.

Read `<run>/capture-results.json`. Captures with `status` `ok`/`check` are
**captured first-try** — done. Captures with a `repairInput` field are the
repairable residual; everything else (other empties/errors, e.g. `pseudo_element`,
`wrong_document_iframe`) is left as an honest soft-fail.

### 5. Repair the residual (the agentic stage)

Only if there are captures with a `repairInput`. This is a **diagnose → apply →
re-measure** loop. The coordinator owns state in
`<run>/repair/loop-state.json`; do not track budget, retries, or
repeated-identical handling in prose.

```bash
bun skill/codex/scripts/repair-loop.js init \
  --run <run> --manifest <manifest-you-captured-with>
bun skill/codex/scripts/repair-loop.js next-prompts --run <run>
```

For each batch printed by `next-prompts`, spawn one local Codex
multi-agent/subagent worker when available (at most 6 at once), or run the same
prompts serially in the current agent. Each worker returns strictly a JSON array
with one item per `captureId`, each containing `primary`, `fallback`, and
`terminal` hypotheses. Save each final JSON message through the coordinator:

```bash
printf '%s\n' "$SUBAGENT_FINAL_JSON" | \
  bun skill/codex/scripts/repair-loop.js save-output \
    --run <run> --batch <batchId>
```

Then apply everything that is ready:

```bash
bun skill/codex/scripts/repair-loop.js apply-ready --run <run>
```

Repeat `next-prompts` → subagent diagnosis → `save-output` → `apply-ready` until
`next-prompts` returns no prompts and `summary` shows no pending work:

```bash
bun skill/codex/scripts/repair-loop.js summary --run <run>
```

`repair-loop.js` enforces `budget=min(2×repairableCount, 24)`,
`maxRetries=2`, repeated-identical terminalization, and batched prompts. It
applies only one ranked hypothesis at a time: primary first, fallback next if the
engine says primary did not converge, then the terminal condition as a stop. It
delegates validation, repair application, re-measurement, and `capture-results`
provenance to `repair-step.js`, so the engine's status is never overridden.

### 6. Assemble + report

```bash
./bin/yoinkit assemble <run>
./bin/yoinkit report <run>
```

`assemble` builds `animations.json` + `animations.md` (the yoinked motion spec); `report` builds
`report.md`. The repaired timelines were promoted into `<run>/timelines/`, so they
flow into the spec automatically.

## What to deliver to the user

Point them at the spec and report, and surface the repair provenance honestly:

- The yoinked motion spec: `<run>/animations.json` and the readable `<run>/animations.md`.
- The report: `<run>/report.md`.
- A short summary distinguishing **captured first-try** vs **captured
  after-repair** vs **honest terminal** (nothing to capture / needs a human), with
  the per-bucket repair count if any repairs ran. For a **targeted** request, lead
  with the animation the user asked about: its layers, timing, easing, and the
  frame timeline.

Never present recreation code — the deliverable is the spec a coding agent rebuilds
from.

## Constraints

- **Real headed browser for capture** (the tool handles this via
  `bin/capture-browser`). Map/plan also runs through the tool; just run from the
  repo root.
- **Surface skipped Static Map assets.** `file:` and cross-origin assets are
  skipped by default, shown in `02-static-map/coverage.md`, and printed by
  `static-map`. Tell the user when skipped assets exist. Do not enable
  `--allow-file-assets`, `--file-asset-root`, `--fetch-public-cross-origin-assets`,
  or `--strict-skipped-assets` unless the human explicitly approves that override
  for the run.
- **Framework-agnostic, no per-site hardcoding.** The diagnosis subagent reasons
  from structure (the §2 `repairContext`), never from a hardcoded selector list.
- **Don't commit captures.** `runs/` and `*.animation.json` are gitignored. Commit
  only skill/tool changes, never run artifacts.
- **The invariant holds end to end.** If you ever find yourself reading a duration
  or easing out of a subagent's reply, stop — that number must come from the
  engine. The subagent only ever names selectors, actions, and a terminal verdict.

# The PRIMARY way to use this tool is the unpacked extension in extension/,
# which injects window.__cap on every page automatically (see README). You only
# need this script if you want the `capture-snippet` clipboard fallback for
# pasting the engine into Chrome DevTools > Sources > Snippets.
#
# It copies the engine to ~/.local/share/yoinkit/ and installs the
# `capture-snippet` helper into ~/.local/bin/.
